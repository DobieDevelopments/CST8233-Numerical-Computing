# CST8233-Numerical-Computing

In this course we learned the usefulness of numerical computing to integrate mathematics and engineering with our programming knowledge using C/C++. Being able to process real-world data with various algorithms to manipulate statistics and perform scientific calculations for an example as in gravity in game programming.

# Catenary Function Assignment
- handle approximation mathemetics to simulate a realtime walkthrough for an architechture company.
- uses Maclaurin and Taylor series approximation formulas.

# Linear Regression Fit to Data Assignment
- taking an input file of data to fit to a line of best fit using linear and power law functions.

# Numerical Differentiation, Martian / Lunar Lander Assignment
-A small console simulation that displays knowledge of solving ordinary differential equations in a game-like format. 
-	Uses mumerical approximations, solving for ordinary differential equations (Euler and Huens).
